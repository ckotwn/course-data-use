Data downloads
There is technically only one way to generate a GBIF download, and that is through the downloads API (https://www.gbif.org/developer/occurrence). Here I list 3 interfaces to the downloads API. All of these send a JSON request with filters to the GBIF servers where it is interpreted and a download is generated. I strongly recommend using rgbif::occ_download() except if you have a very simple request.  

Here is an example using curl. I do not really recommend editing JSON directly for generating downloads. I just present this here for completeness and for better understanding how the downloads API actually works. You can see here that even a very simple download is verbose. 
For building complex reproducible downloads from GBIF, there is no better tool than rgbif::occ_download() for generating occurrence downloads. 
 Especially if you are using R for the rest of your analysis, this will allow you to produce end-to-end scripts of your research.
