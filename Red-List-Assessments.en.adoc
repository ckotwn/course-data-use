= IUCN Red List Assessment

All species have a probability of going extinct due to random events.  
However, some species have a higher probability of extinction of going extinct due to a number of determining factors such as population trends, range and threats faced by the species. 
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species provides a robust and transparent framework in the form of the Categories and Criteria for estimating the risk of extinction ofof  all species across all systems -  marine, terrestrial and freshwater.

It is not the only method for assessing the conservation status of species and regionally different methodologies may be used, however, it is an internationally recognised standard that is acknowledged as a key tool for assessing progress for towards achieving the Aichi bodiversity targets. 

Importanly, the Red List is not a final list of species that are high priorities for conservation action. 
When establishing conservation priorities, it is important to consider financial, cultural, logistical, biological, ethical, social and other factors in addition to extinction risk, to maximize the effectiveness of conservation actions. 
It’s important to keep this in mind when doing Red List assessments, and not to have a preconceived notion of how threatened a species “should” be or in which category it should be listed.

The Red List Categories and Criteria were originally developed for use at the global level, but they can give incorrect assessments of extinction risk when used by themselves for regional assessments. IUCN developed the Guidelines for Application of IUCN Red List Criteria at Regional Levels, which adapt the Red List methodology for regional use (free to download from the Red List website).

All described taxa except microorganism can be assessed including species, subspecies, varieties and subpopulations.  Undescribed species taxa can be assessed, only if they area  clearly distinct species, voucher references are provided, distribution information is available and there is conservation benefit to the assessment.  

Only wild populations inside their natural range, and populations resulting from conservation introductions (also called "benign introductions") should be assessed. 

=== Process
The general assessment process at the global level:

All assessments have (1) Assessors (there may only one named assessor, or there may be more than one person involved in the assessment); and (2) Reviewers (there are at least two named Reviewers who review the assessment and agree that it is an appropriate assessment based on all data currently available for the species).

Assessors fall into two categories: (1) those within the IUCN network (SGs, RLAs, assessment projects managed IUCN staff (including regional offices) and Red List Partner organizations); and (2) those from outside the IUCN network. Anyone with sufficient knowledge of a species and the IUCN criteria can carry out an assessment.

Reviewers are generally from the network of Red List Authorities, which are mostly IUCN Specialist Groups, but where there are gaps, other organisations act as RLAs (e.g., Project Seahorse, BirdLife International, etc).

Assessments coming to the IUCN Red List Unit from within IUCN should already have been through the review process (the RLAs nest within the SGs). These are checked by Red List Unit staff to ensure the criteria have been applied correctly and to pick up on any errors. If anything is wrong with the assessment, it is returned to the assessors. If the assessments are sound, they are added to the IUCN Red List for the next update.

Assessments coming from outside the IUCN network need to go through the peer review process. Red List Unit staff check them and, if there are no problems, forward the assessments onto the appropriate RLA; the RLA then evaluates the assessment and returns it to the Red List Unit. If evaluators agree with the assessment, it is included in the next Red List update. If the evaluators disagree, the assessment is returned to the assessors with an explanation of the problem.

=== The IUCN Categories and Crtieria
Assessments are based on 5 objective scientific criteria, each containing a set of quantitative thresholds against which the risk of extintion of a species can be assessed.  

These 5 criteria are:

Criterion A - Popluation Reduction
Criterion B - Restricted geograhic range
Croterion C - Small population size and decline
Criterion D - Very small or restricted population
Criterion E - Quantitative Analysis

The thresholds for each of these criteria are summarised in the IUCN summary sheet. 
Species must be assessed against all criteria during an assessment and it is the criterion with the highest threat category that is used in an assessment.

Based on a species assessment against these criteria, one of 9 categories can be attributed to a taxon outlined in the diagram below.  
If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD. Full guidance on the application of DD, NT and EX can be found in the IUCN guidelines.

=== Data Quality
The threatened categories use quantitative thresholds but a lack of high quality data should not deter assessors from applying the IUCN criteria.  
Certain metrics within the assessment process can be based on observations, estimations, inferences, suspicions and projections and guidance on when these can be used is given hthe IUCN guidelines and summary sheet.  
The video outlnes the differences between these different data quality types. 

=== Applying Criterion B - Restricted Geographic Range
While GBIF-mediated may provide information that is useful for all criteria, it is for crietion B that GBIF-mediated data can play a critical role in the assessment of a taxon due to the locality information contained within it.  
Remember, however, that in a real assessment, you should apply ALL the criteria when assessing a taxon. 

Criterion B is based on two subcriteria: 

* Criterion B1 – based on the estimated extent of occurrence. And
* Criterion B2 – based on the estimated area of occupancy. 

In order to list a species as threatened under criterion B, it must first meet the thresholds for either criterion B1, or B2, or both B1 and B2. In addition, it must also meet at least two of three subcriteria: 

* The population is severely fragmented, or occurs in few locations.
* There is evidence of continuing decline.
* There is evidence of extreme fluctuations.

The following video provides definitions of the different metrics and terms used within Criterion B and you can apply them for assesing a species using criterion B.


Using GBIF-mediated data for calculations of EOO and AOO
The nature of GBIF-medaited data lends itself to the calculation of EOO and AOO measurements where occurrence points within a species native range can be used for defining the minimum convex polygon or onto which a 2x2km grid can placed for EOO measurements.  A number of tools have been developed for calculating these measurement including ArcGIS toolboxes, the R package red and GeoCat.  The latter provides users with little programming or GIS experience, the ability to take GBIF-mediated data and calculate EOO and AOO measurements.  In the following video, we provide you with an overview of how this tool works.   


=== Mapping standards for IUCN Red List Assessments

Species maps are included on the Red List for several reasons. Primarily, the maps provide a visual representation of the species’ distribution, so people can see where the species is found. 
These data can also be used to conduct many different analyses, such as global threatened species richness for different taxonomic groups, which are then used to inform conservation planning and other decisions. 
The maps can help inform Red List assessments, by allowing calculations of extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO). 
They can also help to identify conservation priorities. 
For example, this data can help identify priority areas for conservation and inform conservation policy; it can help identify gaps in scientific knowledge; and it can help inform business decisions (e.g. where not to expand development).

The species distribution maps, commonly referred to as “limits of distribution” or “field guide” maps, aim to provide the current known distribution of the species within its native range.  
The limits of distribution are determined by using known occurrences of the species, along with knowledge of habitat preferences, remaining suitable habitat, elevation limits, and other expert knowledge of the species and its range. 

In many cases the distribution is depicted as polygons, but it may also be represented by data points (collection records), or a mixture of points and polygons. 
For polygon maps, the polygon shows the limits of the taxon’s distribution, which essentially means that the species probably only occurs within this polygon, but it does not mean that it is distributed equally within that polygon or occurs everywhere within that polygon.

In the video, you can get an overview of the different mapping standards in use for mapping assessed species' distributions.

=== Minimum Documentation
Assessors should provide with their maps, whether they are points, polygons or a combination of both, a set of accompanying attributes i.e. data attached to points and polygons. 
Some of these attributes are required as part of minimum documentation supporting assessments.  
Other attributes are either recommended or optional and a full overiview of these minimum documentation requirements can be found in the mapping guidelines document.
These attribute fields have been mapped to Darwin Core terms in the document to facilitate the fulfilment of minimum documentation requirements when submitting your red list assessments.
