= Assessing the conservation status of a species 
[NOTE.objectives]
This module will introduce you to the basic concepts and terminology associated with assessing the conservation status of a species using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria.  
By the end of the module, you should understand what the conceptual framework of the IUCN Red List of Categories and Criteria and how you can apply them using GBIF-mediated data.

== IUCN Red List of Threatened Species

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species provides a robust and transparent framework in the form of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria for estimating the risk of extinction of  all species across all systems -  marine, terrestrial and freshwater.
It is an internationally recognised standard that can be applied at a global, regional and national level and is acknowledged as a key tool for assessing progress towards achieving bodiversity targets as set out in the Convention on Biological Diversity. 

All species have a probability of going extinct due to random events.  
However, some species have a higher probability of extinction of going extinct due to a number of determining factors such as population trends, range and threats faced by the species. 
Using a set of obective, scientific criteria  quantitive thresholds, the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria allow assessors to use knowledge of a species´ biology and the threats that the species evaluate the extinction risk of a species and assign a conservation status for that species in the form of a Category. 

=== IUCN Red List Categories and Crtiteria

Assessments are based on 5 objective scientific criteria, each containing a set of quantitative thresholds against which the risk of extintion of a species can be assessed.  Species must be assessed against all criteria during an assessment.

These 5 criteria are:

Criterion A - Popluation reduction
Criterion B - Restricted geographic range
Criterion C - Small population size and decline
Criterion D - Very small or restricted population
Criterion E - Quantitative analysis

Each of these criteria have a set of associated thresholds for these biological traits that allow assessors to apply one of 9 categories that indicate extinction risk.

It is the criterion with the highest threat category that is used in an assessment.

=== Red List assessment process 

Assessments that are to be integrated into the global IUCN Red List of Threatened Species can come from coordinated efforts within the IUCN network e.g. link:https://www.iucn.org/commissions/ssc-groups[IUCN Species Survival Commission Specialist Groups] IUCN Species Survival Commission Specialist Groups or from other processes such as the development of national Red Lists, if there are species that are being assessed that are endemic to that country. National Red Listing processes may differ from those prescribed by IUCN, but ANY assessment to be submitted to the global IUCN Red List of Threatened Species will have to go throught the following stages:

* Assessment - Assessors are experts who have sufficient knowledge of a taxon to be able to apply the criteria in an informed way, these experts can come from within the IUCN network such as the link:https://www.iucn.org/commissions/ssc-groups[IUCN Species Survival Commission Specialist Groups] IUCN Species Survival Commission Specialist Groups or from national or regional taxonomic experts.

* Review -  Reviewers of global assessments are generally from the network of Red List Authorities (RLAs), which are mostly IUCN Specialist Groups, but where there are gaps, other organisations act as RLAs (e.g., Project Seahorse, BirdLife International, etc) and agree that they are appropriate based on all data currently available for the species. Assessments coming to the IUCN Red List Unit from within IUCN should already have been through the review process (the RLAs nest within the SGs). Assessments coming from outside the IUCN network need to go through the peer review process.

== GBIF-mediated data and Red List assessments 

The nature of GBIF-mediated data providing georeferenced data on the localities of taxa allows for the data to be of use 

Data Quality
[NOTE.presentation]
The threatened categories use quantitative thresholds but a lack of high quality data should not deter assessors from applying the IUCN criteria.  
Certain metrics within the assessment process can be based on observations, estimations, inferences, suspicions and projections and guidance on when these can be used is given hthe IUCN guidelines and summary sheet.  

In this video (09:27), you will review the differences between these different data quality types.

If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD. Full guidance on the application of DD, NT and EX can be found in the IUCN guidelines.


=== Applying Criterion B - Restricted Geographic Range
While GBIF-mediated may provide information that is useful for all criteria, it is for crietion B that GBIF-mediated data can play a critical role in the assessment of a taxon due to the locality information contained within it.  
Remember, however, that in a real assessment, you should apply ALL the criteria when assessing a taxon. 

Criterion B is based on two subcriteria: 

* Criterion B1 – based on the estimated extent of occurrence. And
* Criterion B2 – based on the estimated area of occupancy. 

In order to list a species as threatened under criterion B, it must first meet the thresholds for either criterion B1, or B2, or both B1 and B2. In addition, it must also meet at least two of three subcriteria: 

* The population is severely fragmented, or occurs in few locations.
* There is evidence of continuing decline.
* There is evidence of extreme fluctuations.

[NOTE.presentation]
The following video provides definitions of the different metrics and terms used within Criterion B and how you can apply them for assesing a species using criterion B.

Using GBIF-mediated data for calculations of EOO and AOO

The nature of GBIF-medaited data lends itself to the calculation of EOO and AOO measurements where occurrence points within a species native range can be used for defining the minimum convex polygon or onto which a 2x2km grid can placed for EOO measurements.  A number of tools have been developed for calculating these measurement including ArcGIS toolboxes, the R package red and GeoCat.  The latter provides users with little programming or GIS experience, the ability to take GBIF-mediated data and calculate EOO and AOO measurements.  In the following video, we provide you with an overview of how this tool works.   


=== Mapping standards for IUCN Red List Assessments

Species maps are included on the Red List for several reasons. Primarily, the maps provide a visual representation of the species’ distribution, so people can see where the species is found. 
These data can also be used to conduct many different analyses, such as global threatened species richness for different taxonomic groups, which are then used to inform conservation planning and other decisions. 
The maps can help inform Red List assessments, by allowing calculations of extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO). 
They can also help to identify conservation priorities. 
For example, this data can help identify priority areas for conservation and inform conservation policy; it can help identify gaps in scientific knowledge; and it can help inform business decisions (e.g. where not to expand development).

The species distribution maps, commonly referred to as “limits of distribution” or “field guide” maps, aim to provide the current known distribution of the species within its native range.  
The limits of distribution are determined by using known occurrences of the species, along with knowledge of habitat preferences, remaining suitable habitat, elevation limits, and other expert knowledge of the species and its range. 

In many cases the distribution is depicted as polygons, but it may also be represented by data points (collection records), or a mixture of points and polygons. 
For polygon maps, the polygon shows the limits of the taxon’s distribution, which essentially means that the species probably only occurs within this polygon, but it does not mean that it is distributed equally within that polygon or occurs everywhere within that polygon.

In the video, you can get an overview of the different mapping standards in use for mapping assessed species' distributions.

=== Minimum Documentation
Assessors should provide with their maps, whether they are points, polygons or a combination of both, a set of accompanying attributes i.e. data attached to points and polygons. 
Some of these attributes are required as part of minimum documentation supporting assessments.  
Other attributes are either recommended or optional and a full overiview of these minimum documentation requirements can be found in the mapping guidelines document.
These attribute fields have been mapped to Darwin Core terms in the document to facilitate the fulfilment of minimum documentation requirements when submitting your red list assessments.
